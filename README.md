# pneumatic-cylinder-static-structral-

We have created a analysis of pneumatic cylinder which is made up of engineering plastic of 2.2e+10 pa of youngs modulus and a poison ratio of .3 .
we have selcted multiple faces and tried to find the multiple results mentioned below 
 The main target was to ditermine that outer cylindrical face should be less than 10 micrometer 

 the evaluated results are as follows:
 total deformation 
 equivalent stress
 principal stress 
 directional deformation
 radial stress
 axial stress 
 circumfrencial stress 

 We have also used cylindrical co-ordinate system as to target some particular areas and find accurate results 

The geometery is not created by me it was taken from a udemy course
